# Mask_RCNN
Goto sample folder, Run "python visualize_cv2.py" in terminal.
Exploring instance segmentation. Followed Mark Jay's tutorial in Youtube, and got it working on my laptop. Stream it on webcam, over Mask_RCNN real-time. But result is only 2fps on my GTX1060. Btw, the creator only got it 5fps. So I guess its just hardware issue.

I will write out details of this very soon. Pls be patient. I got this!!
